## Adding Entities
To add an entity, make sure the slider at the top left of the webpage is set to **Add Entity**.  

Then, select the type of entity you would like to add using the **Type of entity** dropdown and hit the **Add to Scene** button.

### Types of Entities
- Circle
- Plane
- Triangle
- Gradient
- Checkerboard
- Grille

## Editing Entities
**In order to access the editor one or more entities must be added to the scene.**
Once entities have been added to the scene, change the slider to **Edit Entity.**

### Background Settings
#### Background color:  
To change the background color, select a new color or enter the hexadecimal code of the desired color.

### Universal Entity Settings
#### Position: (x deg, y world units)
To edit the position, locate the position text boxes under **Universal Settings**. The left box refers to the x position and the y position.  

The position of an entity refers to where its center point is located. The editor interfaces the three axis in different manners. 
Positional data is calculated based on a cylinder that encompasses the camera. The radius of this cylinder cannot be changed, however the cylinder has an infinite height. The x and z axes are responsible for horizontal positioning. The y axis controls the vertical position.

   - x-axis: This axis is in terms of **degrees** where 1 degree references 1 degree of clockwise rotation away from the fixed camera center on the cylinder.
   - y-axis: This axis is in terms of **world units** where 1 world unit is equal to 1 meter in 3D space. 
   - z-axis: **The z-axis is NOT editable by users.** The location on the z-axis is automatically calculated based on the x-axis angle.

The reason that the radius of the cylinder is not editable is due to the fact that all entities are 2-dimensional. Changing their depth would essentially have the same effect as making entities smaller or larger.

#### Rotation: Î¸ deg
To edit the rotation, locate the rotation text box under **Universal Settings**.

For this program, the rotation of an entity refers to rotation around the **z-axis only**. The axis of rotation is located at the center point of entity. The unit for rotation is **degrees** where 1 degree refers to one degree of rotation about the axis of rotation.
