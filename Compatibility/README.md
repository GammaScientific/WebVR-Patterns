## Using the Tool
Open a compatible browser on the desired headset and hit the ***VR*** button.  The device connected is automatically detected and the controller layout is displayed if controllers are found. As inputs are recieved from the controllers, the corresponding textboxes will be converted to green. A json file can be produced that will indicate what buttons were pressed.
