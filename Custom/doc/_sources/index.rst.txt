Welcome to Pattern Generation Tool's documentation!
===================================================
The Pattern Generation Tool provides a user interface for creating, editing, and displaying `WebXR <https://immersiveweb.dev/>`_ scenes. Scenes consist of 2 and 3 dimensional entities taken from `A-Frame <https://aframe.io/docs/1.4.0/core/entity.html>`_. These entities can be manipulated in a variety of different ways to create flexible patterns. Scenes are grouped together in packages that can be downloaded and shared.
