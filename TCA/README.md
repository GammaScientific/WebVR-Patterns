# TCA Test Instructions

## Setup
You can move the centering and change the offset of the bars from the center point while in VR mode also.  
In addition, you can control the size of the step for these. The step starts at 1 degree by default and can be changed by +- 0.1 degree.
It is universal, so changing the step when in centering mode will also change the step size when in offset mode. This is all done on the left controller.

Once you have found a good centering and offset, I recommend pressing the menu button on the left controller to exit VR mode and jotting these values down. These values will be stored in the center and offset text boxes.  
You can input these values when you open the website so you don't need to redo the centering/offset everytime.

## Moving Bars
The program allows you to control the red, green, or blue segments in both of the two bars. **You can only move one segment of a single bar at a time**. This is done with the right controller.
